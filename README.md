# Wave Movement Simulation using Perlin Noise

This project is a simulation of wave movement implemented using Perlin noise in the p5.js coding library. By leveraging Perlin noise, a popular algorithm for generating natural-looking patterns, this simulation creates dynamic and realistic wave-like movements.

## Features
- Realistic wave simulation
- Smooth transitions and fluid movements
- Adjustable detail level for controlling the clarity of the simulation
- Easy-to-understand codebase for further exploration and modification

## Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the source files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Interact with the simulation using the slider.
4. Use the slider to adjust the detail level for clearer wave patterns.

## Dependencies
- p5.js: A JavaScript library for creative coding, providing a full set of drawing functionality.

## Acknowledgements
- The p5.js community for their valuable contributions and support.
- Ken Perlin for his pioneering work on Perlin noise, which forms the foundation of this simulation.
